description: "This playbook is triggered by fetching a Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR
  incident. \nThe playbook syncs and updates new XDR alerts that construct the incident.
  It enriches indicators using Threat Intelligence integrations and Palo Alto Networks
  AutoFocus. The incident's severity is then updated based on the indicators reputation
  and an analyst is assigned for manual investigation. If chosen, automated remediation
  with Palo Alto Networks FireWall is initiated. After a manual review by the
  SOC analyst, the XDR incident is closed automatically.\n\n*** Note - The XDRSyncScript
  used by this playbook sets data in the XDR incident fields that were released
  to content from the Demisto server version 5.0.0.\nFor Demisto versions under 5.0.0,
  please follow the 'Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR' documentation to upload the new
  fields manually."
